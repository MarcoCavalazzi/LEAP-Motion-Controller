# LEAP Motion Controller index pointer

The project aims at creating a touchless interface for the user to control the mouse mouvement and clicks with the gesture of a single finger, the index, exploiting the LEAP Motion Controller interface.
In order to communicate to the LEAL Motion Controller we are using the Leap Motion SDK: https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/csharp/devguide/Leap_SDK_Overview.html
